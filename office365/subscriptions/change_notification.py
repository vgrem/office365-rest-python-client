        changeType (str): Indicates the type of change that will raise the change notification. The supported values
          are: created, updated, deleted. Required.

          The maximum length is 255 characters. The client can check whether the change notification came from the
          service by comparing the values of the clientState property. The value of the clientState property sent with
          the subscription is compared with the value of the clientState property received with each change notification.
        encryptedContent (ChangeNotificationEncryptedContent): Encrypted content attached with the change notification.
          Only provided if encryptionCertificate and includeResourceData were defined during the subscription request
          and if the resource supports it. Optional.
        resource (str): The URI of the resource that emitted the change notification relative to
          https://graph.microsoft.com. Required
        resourceData (ResourceData): The content of this property depends on the type of resource being subscribed to.
