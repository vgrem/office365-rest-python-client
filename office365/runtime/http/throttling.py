"""Parsing and reacting to throttling / health signals on responses.

SharePoint Online reports server load via ``X-SharePointHealthScore`` on every
response and ``Retry-After`` on throttled (429/503) responses. Per the current
Microsoft guidance it does **not** return IETF ``RateLimit-*`` headers — those
are parsed defensively here in case a proxy or other source provides them.

Two distinct concerns live here:

**Control** — act on the signals to pace the fleet. :class:`RateLimiter` +
:func:`paced` (used by ``ThrottledTransport``) gate every send and observe every
response, including failures, without touching error propagation. This is the
mature pipeline/transport-policy pattern (Azure ``RetryPolicy``, botocore
adaptive mode, urllib3 ``Retry``).

**Observability** — report the signals to the caller. :func:`rate_limit_hook`
and :func:`throttle_guard` attach to the request's ``afterExecute`` event and
never change control flow. Use these when you only want to *know* about
throttling; use the limiter when you want to *act* on it.

Note: request ``onError`` handlers mark an error as handled (they swallow it —
see :meth:`ClientRequest.on_error`), so they must not be used for observation.
