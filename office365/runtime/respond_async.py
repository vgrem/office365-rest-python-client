"""Submit requests with ``Prefer: respond-async``.

Some Microsoft 365 services document the OData ``Prefer: respond-async``
preference on operations that may take longer than a single request (notably the
Excel workbook APIs and other long-running actions). Instead of holding the
connection open, the service answers ``202 Accepted`` with a ``Location`` header
pointing at an *operation-status* (monitor) URL. Requests that finish quickly are
answered normally, so the preference is a hint rather than a guarantee.

This module bridges that pair onto the generic poller in
:mod:`office365.runtime.lro`. It builds the request for a query, attaches the
preference, and executes it through the normal request pipeline (auth,
``client-request-id``, throttling) — then:

* returns a :class:`~office365.runtime.lro.LongRunningOperationResult` when the
  service accepted the request asynchronously; poll it with ``wait()`` /
  ``wait_async()``, or
* returns ``None`` when the service completed the request synchronously, after
  feeding the response into the query so its regular return value is populated.

Example::

    from office365.runtime.queries.create_entity import CreateEntityQuery
    from office365.runtime.respond_async import RespondAsyncRequest

    row = rows.create_typed_object()
    query = CreateEntityQuery(rows, row, row)
    operation = RespondAsyncRequest(context, query, wait=10).execute()
    if operation is not None:
        operation.wait()  # the server accepted the work asynchronously
