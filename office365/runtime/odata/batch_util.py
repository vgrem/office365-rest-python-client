"""Batch request sizing utilities.

Proactive chunking: batches are split by sub-request **count** and by estimated
**payload bytes** so a batch never exceeds a service request-size limit.
Reactive fallback: a whole-batch transport rejection (nothing was applied) is
signalled with :class:`WholeBatchRejected`, which callers halve and retry.
