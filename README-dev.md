# Local development

Run the tests and the runnable examples in `examples/` on your machine.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vgrem/office365-rest-python-client.git
cd office365-rest-python-client

uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate       # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv sync --all-extras
```

Using `pip`: `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -e ".[examples,ntlm]" pytest`

## Run offline tests (no tenant)

```bash
uv run pytest --offline -q
```

That is the whole setup for most contributions. Continue only to run against a real tenant.

## Set up live authentication

Credentials live in one `.env` at the repo root (loaded automatically, nothing to
`export`). Verify what is configured at any time:

```bash
uv run python -m tests.doctor
```

### 1. Create `.env`

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Register app in Entra (manual)

[Register an app](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app),
then fill in the tenant, client ID and an admin account:

```dotenv
OFFICE365_TENANT=contoso.onmicrosoft.com
OFFICE365_CLIENT_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
OFFICE365_ADMIN_USERNAME=admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com
```

The admin needs **Global Administrator**, **Privileged Role Administrator** or
**Application Administrator**.

### 3. Grant permissions

Both scripts sign in as `OFFICE365_ADMIN_USERNAME` and apply admin consent:

```bash
uv run python examples/entraid/applications/grant_application_perms.py   # app-only roles
uv run python examples/entraid/applications/grant_delegated_perms.py     # delegated scopes
```

Each prompts for the permission name, e.g. `Sites.FullControl.All` or `User.Read.All`.

### 4. User context (ROPC / delegated)

`OFFICE365_USERNAME` is the primary test user and the ROPC account; the optional
`OFFICE365_USERNAME_ALT` adds a second account for sharing/delegation tests.

```dotenv
OFFICE365_USERNAME=user1@contoso.onmicrosoft.com
OFFICE365_PASSWORD=your-password
# OFFICE365_USERNAME_ALT=user2@contoso.onmicrosoft.com
```

Needs MFA off for the ROPC user. For interactive examples, also add a redirect URI and
the **Allow public client flows** toggle:

```bash
uv run python examples/entraid/applications/redirect_uris.py
```

### 5. App-only

The guided wizard generates `.env` for you. It reads the values already present,
prompts only for the tenant and sign-in app id when they are missing, signs in,
reuses or generates one self-signed certificate (valid for both Graph and
SharePoint), optionally creates a client secret, and derives the SharePoint URLs
from the tenant name (or the signed-in UPN):

```bash
uv run python -m tests.setup
```

Everything else — the admin/primary usernames, the optional secondary user and
shared mailbox, and the `*_SITE_URL` defaults — is discovered or derived.
Re-running reuses what is already there; `--dry-run` previews the `.env` merge
without signing in or writing:

```bash
uv run python -m tests.setup --dry-run
```

Prerequisite: the app allows public client flows and has the delegated
`Application.ReadWrite.All` permission with admin consent (steps 2–3). Permissions
are still granted separately (step 3). Prefer the individual scripts?

```bash
# Certificate (Graph) and a SharePoint site
uv run python examples/entraid/applications/rotate_cert.py --generate
uv run python examples/sharepoint/auth/setup/certificate_auth.py \
    --site https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/project

# Client secret (Graph only — SharePoint REST API v1 rejects secrets)
uv run python examples/entraid/applications/rotate_secret.py
```

Then run tests and examples — missing credentials are skipped, not failed:

```bash
uv run pytest -q
uv run python examples/auth/with_client_secret.py
```
