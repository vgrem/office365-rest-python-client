# Async / await

Run the same fluent API from `async` code. Builders stay synchronous — only the
terminal calls that hit the network gain an `_async` twin that you `await`:

| Synchronous | Asynchronous |
|---|---|
| `ctx.execute_query()` | `await ctx.execute_query_async()` |
| `obj.execute_query()` | `await obj.execute_query_async()` |
| `ctx.execute_query_retry()` | `await ctx.execute_query_async_retry()` |
| `ctx.execute_query_with_incremental_retry()` | `await ctx.execute_query_with_incremental_retry_async()` |
| `ctx.execute_query_parallel()` | `await ctx.execute_query_parallel_async()` |
| `ctx.execute_batch()` | `await ctx.execute_batch_async()` |
| `obj.execute_batch()` | `await obj.execute_batch_async()` |
| `result.execute_query_retry()` | `await result.execute_query_async_retry()` |
| `ctx.execute_request_direct(path)` | `await ctx.execute_request_direct_async(path)` |
| `collection.get_all()` | `await collection.get_all_async()` |
| `for item in collection` | `async for item in collection` |
| `folder.download(dir).execute_query()` | `await folder.download(dir).execute_query_async()` |
| `file.download_session(stream)` | `await file.download_session_async(stream)` |

No extra dependency is required. By default the blocking HTTP call is handed to
a worker thread, so the event loop stays free and existing transports (session,
auth, proxies, rate limiting) are reused unchanged.

## Quick start

```python
import asyncio

from office365.sharepoint.client_context import ClientContext

ctx = ClientContext(site_url).with_username_and_password(tenant, client_id, username, password)


async def main() -> None:
    web = await ctx.web.get().execute_query_async()
    print(web.title)


asyncio.run(main())
```

`execute_query_async()` returns the same object as its synchronous twin, so the
patterns you already use (`await ctx.web.get().execute_query_async()`, reading
`.value`, chaining) are unchanged.

## Concurrency

A context drains its own pending query queue on every call. To run independent
requests concurrently, give each one its own [cloned](getting-started.md) context
(the clone shares credentials and the connection pool) and await them together:

```python
web_ctx = ctx.clone(site_url)
lists_ctx = ctx.clone(site_url)

web, lists = await asyncio.gather(
    web_ctx.web.get().execute_query_async(),
    lists_ctx.web.lists.get().execute_query_async(),
)
```

For many queued operations, prefer the batch API below — it overlaps batches
without hand-managing contexts.

### Parallel queries on one context

When you have queued several **independent** requests (e.g. a metadata read per
file), drain them together with `execute_query_parallel_async()`. It overlaps the
network round-trips with bounded concurrency and per-query retry, so you don't
need clones, a `Semaphore`, or `as_completed`:

```python
def report(progress):
    print(f"{progress.stage}: {progress.done}/{progress.total}")

folder = ctx.web.get_folder_by_server_relative_url("/sites/contoso/Shared Documents")
files = await folder.files.get().execute_query_async()
for file in files:
    file.ensure_property("Length")  # queue one read per file

await ctx.execute_query_parallel_async(concurrency=6, progress=report)
```

It is the `await` twin of `execute_query_parallel()`, with the same
`concurrency`/`progress`/`max_retry` arguments. It routes each request through
the configured async transport, so it also drives the optional `httpx` engine
below.

Both forms take an optional keyword-only `on_error=(query, error) -> None`
collector: when supplied, a permanently failing query is reported to it and
skipped instead of aborting the batch (this is what bulk downloads use to
continue-and-report). Without it, the first permanent failure raises as before.

For downloads specifically you don't need this primitive directly — use the
high-level API below.

## Download

Downloading a folder, a file collection, or a single file is a builder + terminal
pair like every other query, so one name gives you both forms:

```python
# asynchronous
op = folder.download("/data/docs")
await op.execute_query_async(concurrency=8)

# synchronous — same builder
op = folder.download("/data/docs")
op.execute_query()
```

Like every other terminal, `execute_query()` / `await execute_query_async()`
return the operation itself; the outcome is on `op.value`.

`folder.download(target_dir)` enumerates the folder (paged, recursive by
default), preserves the relative tree under `target_dir`, and downloads the files
with bounded concurrency and per-file retry. `files.download(target_dir)`
downloads one collection flat; `file.download(path)` downloads a single file.
No streams, no `ExitStack`, no handle bookkeeping — the operation opens and
closes each destination itself.

Domain intent stays on the builder; execution knobs stay on the terminal:

| Builder (`download`) | Terminal (`execute_query` / `execute_query_async`) |
|---|---|
| `target_dir`, `recursive`, `overwrite`, `resume`, `progress` | `concurrency`, `max_retry`, `timeout_secs`, `max_delay`, `jitter` |

`op.value` is a `DownloadResult`:

```python
op = folder.download("/data/docs")
op.execute_query(concurrency=8)
result = op.value
print(result.success, result.skipped, result.errors)
for file, error in result.failures:
    print("failed", file.server_relative_url, error)
```

- **Resumable by default** — `overwrite=False` skips files that already exist, so
  re-running continues where it stopped. Pass `overwrite=True` to replace.
- **Resume partial files** — with `resume=True`, an existing destination smaller
  than the remote file is completed by fetching only the missing byte range
  (HTTP `Range`) and appending it, so an interrupted large download is not
  restarted from scratch. A destination at least as large as the remote file is
  treated as complete and skipped; servers that ignore the range (a `200` with
  the full body) still produce a correct file.
- **Continue-and-report** — a permanently failing file is collected in
  `result.failures` (and counted in `result.errors`); the rest keep downloading.
  Call `result.raise_if_errors()` to opt back into fail-fast.
- **Progress** — `progress` receives `Progress` snapshots: `stage="scanning"`
  while enumerating, `stage="downloading"` with `done`/`total` while transferring.

Under the hood this is the builder form of the parallel primitive above: it
queues one `get_content()` per file and drains it with
`execute_query_parallel(_async)`, bound to the destination paths.

### Streaming large files

`file.download(path)` buffers each file in memory before writing it. For large
files, open the destination yourself and use `download_session_async()`: it
streams the body chunk by chunk through the async transport (native with
`httpx`, otherwise a worker thread), so the content is never buffered and the
event loop never blocks:

```python
with open("/data/big.iso", "wb") as stream:
    await file.download_session_async(
        stream,
        chunk_size=1024 * 1024,
        progress=lambda p: print(p.done, p.total),
    )
```

The synchronous `file.download_session(stream)` is the twin; both accept
`chunk_downloaded(bytes_so_far)`, `chunk_size`, `use_path` and `progress`. The
awaitable form ensures the addressing property is loaded first and raises the
same `ClientRequestException` on failure as the rest of the async API.

## Recipes

End-to-end examples that show where async pays off:

- [Audit every site collection concurrently](products/async/tenant_site_audit.md) —
  bounded fan-out over a tenant, replacing an N+1 sequential loop.
- [Download a library concurrently](products/async/download_library_async.md) —
  progress as each file finishes, per-file retry.
- [Bulk-update list items](products/async/bulk_update_async.md) —
  `execute_batch_async` sends the batches in parallel.
- [Show the current user](products/sharepoint/users/whoami_async.md) — the
  minimal async query, the `await` twin of `whoami.py`.

## Batch

`execute_batch_async()` splits pending changes exactly like `execute_batch()` and
sends each batch through the configured async transport (native if one is set,
otherwise a worker thread), so the loop is never blocked. Only the
transiently-failed sub-requests are resent, honoring `Retry-After`. With
`concurrency` > 1 the batches overlap:

```python
target_list = ctx.web.lists.get_by_title("Company Tasks")
for index in range(250):
    target_list.add_item({"Title": f"Task {index}"})

await ctx.execute_batch_async(items_per_batch=100, concurrency=4)
```

Graph's JSON batch keeps its `sequential=True` option (chained `dependsOn`)
exactly as the synchronous method:

```python
await client.execute_batch_async(items_per_batch=20, sequential=True)
```

## Paging

`get_all_async()` is the awaitable twin of `get_all()`: it follows
server-driven paging (`@odata.nextLink`, or the SharePoint `$skip` fallback)
until the collection is exhausted, without blocking the loop:

```python
files = ctx.web.get_folder_by_server_relative_url("/sites/contoso/Shared Documents").files
await files.get_all_async(page_size=2000, progress=lambda p: print(p.done))
for file in files:
    print(file.name)
```

Collections are also async iterables, so you can stream page by page without
loading everything first — the first page is fetched on demand and each
remaining page is awaited as it is reached:

```python
files = ctx.web.get_folder_by_server_relative_url("/sites/contoso/Shared Documents").files.paged(2000)
async for file in files:
    print(file.name)
```

Both forms reuse `progress` / `page_loaded` and follow the same server-driven
paging (`@odata.nextLink`, or the SharePoint `$skip` fallback) as the
synchronous `for file in collection`.

### Repeated rows and `$top`

Two paging caveats worth knowing:

- **`$top` can suppress the next link.** On some Graph endpoints an explicit
  `$top` (the `.top(n)` builder) makes the service return a single page and omit
  `@odata.nextLink`, so an otherwise complete `get_all()` stops early. To read
  everything, drive the page size with `page_size=` / `paged(page_size)` and let
  the library follow the links, instead of capping the whole query with `$top`.
- **A service can repeat rows across pages.** Graph directory-export APIs are
  known to return the same item on two consecutive pages during a service
  update. Pass `dedupe_by="id"` to `get_all()` / `get_all_async()` to keep only
  the first occurrence of each value. De-duplication runs after the last page
  loads, so it never disturbs the `$skip` offsets:

  ```python
  users = ctx.users
  await users.get_all_async(page_size=200, dedupe_by="id")
  ```

## Throttling

Async requests share the exact same pacing gate as synchronous ones. When a
context is configured with `with_rate_limit(...)`, the gate is awaited on the
event loop (`RateLimiter.acquire_async`) and every response — including each
sub-response of a batch — is observed, so concurrent async tasks ease off
together instead of blocking a worker thread.

## Retry

`execute_query_async_retry()` mirrors `execute_query_retry()` but waits between
attempts with `asyncio.sleep`, so other tasks keep running:

```python
await ctx.execute_query_async_retry(max_retry=5, timeout_secs=5, max_delay=60)
```

The retry policy mirrors `execute_query_retry` exactly: transient errors
(408/429/5xx and connection errors) are retried with exponential backoff and
jitter. Pass a `failure_callback` (for example returning the server's
`Retry-After` via `retry_after_delay`) to override the backoff.

## Async context manager

`ClientContext` can be used as an async context manager; on exit the transport is
closed without blocking the loop:

```python
async with ctx:
    web = await ctx.web.get().execute_query_async()
```

## Optional native-async transport

The default transport offloads blocking `requests` calls to a thread. If you
prefer genuinely asynchronous I/O, install the optional
[`httpx`](https://www.python-httpx.org/) extra and select it for the async path
only — synchronous calls keep using `requests`:

```bash
pip install office365-rest-python-client[httpx]
```

```python
from office365.runtime.transport.httpx_transport import HttpxTransport

ctx.pending_request().with_async_transport(HttpxTransport())
try:
    web = await ctx.web.get().execute_query_async()
finally:
    await ctx.pending_request().async_transport.aclose()
```

!!! note "Limits of the httpx transport"
    Responses are adapted to `requests.Response`, so downstream code is
    unchanged. Non-streaming bodies are read eagerly into memory; streamed
    downloads use the native `aiter_bytes` path and are never buffered. TLS
    verification, proxies and redirect policy are client-level constructor
    settings; per-request `verify` and `proxies` are not honored.

## Notes

- Async support is additive: nothing in the synchronous API changed, and both
  paths can share one context. Builders remain synchronous; call them before
  `await`ing.
- The async batch path now sends through the request's async transport and
  retries only transiently-failed sub-requests, exactly like the synchronous
  path; it no longer offloads the whole synchronous batch. Blocking
  `beforeExecute` hooks (token acquisition, digest refresh) are offloaded to a
  worker thread so they cannot stall the loop.
- If an async parallel run is cancelled, the queries that were not applied are
  put back on the context's queue and the current query is cleared, so a retry
  resumes cleanly.
- `retry_async()` and the async terminals are available from
  `office365.runtime.retry` and the usual query objects.
