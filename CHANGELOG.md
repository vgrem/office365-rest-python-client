## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Long-running operations (LRO):** a first-class, transport-agnostic
  `OperationPoller` (`office365.runtime.lro`) for the Microsoft Graph async
  pattern — `OperationPoller.from_response(...)` plus blocking `wait()` and
  awaitable `wait_async()`, poll-URL resolution (`Operation-Location` /
  `Azure-AsyncOperation` / `Location` / `original-url`), `Retry-After`-driven
  pacing with automatic `429`/`503` back-off, terminal-state detection, an
  `on_progress` snapshot hook, and serializable `ContinuationToken`s that resume
  an operation in a later call or process. Monitor URLs are polled without
  credentials by default (Graph monitor URLs are unauthenticated and may be
  cross-host); pass `authenticate=True` for services that require it.
- **Waitable Graph long-running operations:** `LongRunningOperationResult`
  (`office365.runtime.lro`) wraps an action's monitor URL with blocking `wait()` /
  awaitable `wait_async()`, and `DriveItem.copy()` now returns a
  `DriveItemCopyResult` whose `wait_for_item()` / `wait_for_item_async()` poll the
  copy to completion and return the new `DriveItem`.
- **Waitable operation entities:** a `PollableOperation` mixin
  (`office365.runtime.pollable`) gives `RichLongRunningOperation`,
  `WorkbookOperation`, `TelephoneNumberLongRunningOperation` and
  `TeamsAsyncOperation` direct `wait()` / `wait_async()` polling, honoring
  `Retry-After`, treating a transient `404` as a "not created yet" gap, and
  raising `OperationTimeoutError` / `OperationFailedError` on failure.
- **Async Teams operation polling:** `TeamsAsyncOperation.poll_for_status_async`
  and `wait_for_operation_async` await an operation on the event loop (no
  blocking), with `Retry-After` pacing and the same `404`-gap tolerance.
- **`Prefer: respond-async` submissions:** `office365.runtime.http.prefer`
  (`RESPOND_ASYNC`, `prefer_respond_async`) and `RespondAsyncRequest`
  (`office365.runtime.respond_async`) submit a query with the OData
  `respond-async` preference (as used by the Excel workbook APIs) and bridge the
  outcome onto the LRO poller — a `202 Accepted` becomes a waitable
  `LongRunningOperationResult`, while a synchronous response fills the query's
  regular result. Sync and async (`execute` / `execute_async`) entry points.
- **Streamed report export:** `ReportRoot.download_report` /
  `download_report_async` (and `office365.reports.report_export`) follow the
  reports API's `302` redirect straight to the pre-authenticated download URL and
  stream the CSV/JSON chunk-by-chunk into a path or binary stream — no full-report
  buffering — returning a `ReportExportResult` with the bytes written and the
  server's `Content-Disposition` file name. `progress` reports bytes as they land.
- **Async/await support:** async twins of the terminal query API —
  `ClientRuntimeContext.execute_query_async`, `ClientObject.execute_query_async`,
  `ClientResult.execute_query_async`, `execute_query_async_retry`, and
  `async with ctx:`. The default transport offloads the blocking `requests` call to
  a worker thread (`BaseTransport.execute_async`), so no extra dependency is needed.
  See `docs/async.md`.
- **Async batching:** `ClientContext.execute_batch_async` and
  `GraphClient.execute_batch_async`, with per-request retry honoring `Retry-After`
  and optional `concurrency`.
- **Async parallel queries:** `ClientRuntimeContext.execute_query_parallel_async`
  (awaitable twin of `execute_query_parallel`) with `concurrency`, retry, and
  `progress`.
- **Async paging:** `ClientObjectCollection.get_all_async(page_size, ...)` and
  `async for item in collection`.
- **Async streaming export:** `RecordCollection.export_to_async` (and
  `List.export_to_async`) streams an appendable format (CSV/TSV/NDJSON/JSON) page
  by page on the worker pool — bounded memory, the loop stays free, and the target
  is closed on cancellation/failure. Without `page_size` the loaded collection is
  written in one offloaded pass.
- **Async pacing parity:** `RateLimiter.acquire_async`/`paced_async` and
  `ThrottledTransport.execute_async`/`aclose`.
- **Async cancellation cleanup:** an aborted parallel run cancels its in-flight
  sibling requests, and both the parallel and sequential drains restore unapplied
  queries and clear the current query so a retry can resume.
- **Async auth offload:** `ClientRequest.before_execute_async` runs `beforeExecute`
  hooks (token/digest/user callbacks) on a worker thread.
- **Async retry:** `retry_async` in `office365.runtime.retry`.
- **High-level bulk download:** `Folder.download`, `FileCollection.download` and
  `File.download` return a `DownloadOperation` — paged/recursive enumeration,
  relative tree, `overwrite=False` resume, bounded concurrency, per-file retry, and
  `DownloadResult.failures`/`stats`/`raise_if_errors()`.
- **`on_error` collector for parallel queries:** `execute_query_parallel` /
  `..._async` accept `on_error=(query, error) -> None`; a permanently failing query
  is reported and skipped instead of aborting the batch.
- **Optional native-async transport:** `HttpxTransport` behind the `[httpx]` extra,
  enabled per request via `ClientRequest.with_async_transport(...)`.
- **Streaming transport contract:** `BaseTransport.stream`/`stream_async` (optional
  `on_headers`), implemented natively by `HttpxTransport`.
- **Async streaming downloads:** `File.download_session_async(stream, ...)` with the
  same `chunk_downloaded`/`chunk_size`/`use_path`/`progress` behavior.
- **Async content streams and lifecycle:** `DriveItem.get_content_stream_async` /
  `File.get_content_stream_async` yield the file body chunk by chunk for piping to
  any destination (socket, second upload, hash) with an optional `on_headers`
  callback, and close the HTTP response on early exit/cancellation;
  `ClientContext.close()` / `await ClientContext.aclose()` release the transport
  when not using `with` / `async with`.
- **Async large-file uploads:** `DriveItem.resumable_upload_async(path, ...)` creates
  the upload session and PUTs every chunk without blocking the loop — each chunk is
  read from disk on the offload executor and sent through the async transport, with
  optional `chunk_uploaded`/`progress` reporting. The reusable
  `UploadSessionRequest.execute_query_async` drives the same chunk loop for other
  upload-session callers. For SharePoint libraries,
  `FileCollection.create_upload_session_async(path, size, ...)` is the awaitable
  twin of `create_upload_session` with the same `chunk_uploaded`/`progress`
  semantics.
- **Tunable async offload executor:** blocking transport work is offloaded to a
  dedicated, lazily-created process-wide pool instead of the event loop's shared
  default executor. Size it with `configure_offload_executor(max_workers=...)`,
  release it with `shutdown_offload_executor()`, or give a transport its own via
  `BaseTransport.offload_executor`.
- **Tunable connection pool:** `with_transport` (Graph and SharePoint) and
  `RequestsTransport` accept `pool_connections`, `pool_maxsize` and `pool_block`
  to size each session's `requests` `HTTPAdapter`. Defaults match `requests`;
  the settings are ignored when a custom `session=` is supplied.
- **Async token callbacks:** `with_access_token` (Graph and SharePoint) now accepts
  an `async def` callback. The async API awaits it on the event loop (single-flight,
  and cached for its `expiresIn`), so token acquisition can use genuinely
  asynchronous I/O; the token is primed before an async batch payload is built,
  whose sub-requests are authenticated synchronously. Requests authenticated this
  way are marked so the offloaded synchronous auth hook skips them, and the
  synchronous API raises a clear error instead of failing with an unreadable token.
  See `docs/async.md`.
- **Async SharePoint migration monitoring:** `MigrationServerJob` gains awaitable
  twins `progress_async` / `all_events_async` / `errors_async` / `status_fn_async`
  / `monitor_async`, so a `GetMigrationJobProgress` ingestion job can be polled
  off the event loop — and several jobs watched concurrently.

### Documentation
- **Long-running-operations guide** (`docs/long-running-operations.md`): the
  end-to-end story for the Graph async pattern — the raw `OperationPoller`,
  waitable results and operation entities, `Prefer: respond-async`, the status
  vocabulary, continuation tokens, batch-vs-LRO guidance, and the out-of-band
  pattern for SharePoint work that has no REST status endpoint.
- **Async example catalog:** practical scripts across the whole surface —
  `examples/async/` `copy_drive_item_async.py`, `wait_team_clone_async.py`,
  `workbook_operation_async.py`, `resume_operation_async.py`,
  `lro_in_batch_guard.py`, `export_report_async.py`, `stream_download_async.py`,
  `client_lifecycle_async.py`, `tune_offload_executor.py`, `retry_async.py`,
  `page_users_async.py`, `delta_sync_async.py`, `upload_large_file_sp_async.py`,
  `entra_token_cache_async.py`, `copy_queue_worker_async.py`,
  `provision_teams_async.py` and `archive_old_files_async.py`, plus
  `examples/sharepoint/migration/monitor/monitor_async.py`,
  `examples/reports/export_usage_async.py`,
  `examples/onedrive/files/copy_and_wait.py` and `examples/teams/wait_for_clone.py`.
- **SharePoint getting-started onboarding:** `examples/sharepoint/getting-started/`
  adds a full-cycle `setup_sharepoint_app.py` (reuse/create the app registration,
  attach a self-signed certificate, grant `Sites.Selected` with admin consent,
  grant per-site access, write `.env`) plus a first-call `hello_sharepoint.py`
  and a walkthrough that answers the app-registration, certificate, and
  permission-scope questions. The SharePoint product README is now a guided hub
  (start here → common tasks → full catalog), and the auth pages cross-link it.

### Fixed
- **Graph device-flow sign-in prompts once:** `AuthenticationContext.with_device_flow`
  reuses the account via `acquire_token_silent` before starting a new device flow.
- **Chat members after creation:** `ChatCollection.add` uses a shared placeholder
  path so `members` resolves to `/chats/{id}/members` once the id is assigned.
- **Batch GETs after `File.get_content()`:** `BatchQuery` treats `FunctionQuery` as a
  GET, so it is placed outside the change set; the v3 batch response parser also
  splits sub-responses at the header/body separator and keeps the body as raw bytes
  so binary downloads survive ([#871](https://github.com/vgrem/office365-rest-python-client/issues/871)).
- **Multi-phase writes in SharePoint batches:** `ClientContext.execute_batch` /
  `execute_batch_async` drain the queue in dependency order, resolving each
  `DeferredOperationQuery` barrier so its handlers enqueue the next round, and fire
  per-query `before_execute`/`after_execute` handlers. A query targeting
  `/_api/$batch` is flagged `batchable = False` and run on its own. Fixes
  `DocumentSet.create(...)` followed by `execute_batch()`
  ([#868](https://github.com/vgrem/office365-rest-python-client/issues/868)).
- **List item creates in batches:** `ListItem.ensure_type_name` now defers the
  queued create until `ListItemEntityTypeFullName` is read, so an `add_item` /
  `update` batched via `execute_batch` is serialized with the correct
  `SP.Data.<List>ListItem` annotation instead of the open `SP.ListItem` type.
  Fixes "An open collection property ... was found"
  ([#717](https://github.com/vgrem/office365-rest-python-client/issues/717)).
- **Thread-safe default transport:** `RequestsTransport` now keeps one
  `requests.Session` per thread instead of sharing a single session, so parallel
  and offloaded async requests no longer race on one connection pool.
  `reset_connections()` resets only the calling thread's pool, and `close()`
  releases every session the transport created.
- **Certificate path from a nested working directory:** `tests/settings.py`
  resolves a relative `OFFICE365_CERT_PATH` (documented as
  `tests/selfsigncert.pem`) against the repository root, so examples and tests
  that use app-only certificate auth run from any directory.
- **Transport-level TLS verification and proxies are applied:** `with_transport(
  verify=False)`, `with_transport(proxies=...)`, and a custom CA bundle set on a
  supplied `session` now reach `requests`. `RequestOptions.verify` defaults to
  unset (`None`), so it no longer forces `verify=True` and silently overrides the
  transport/session value; a per-request value still wins.
- **`httpx` per-request `NO_TIMEOUT`:** the sentinel is translated to httpx's
  "no timeout" instead of being forwarded verbatim (which raised `TypeError`).
- **Streaming export stayed bounded-memory:** `RecordCollection.export_to(...,
  page_size=...)` iterated the collection while reading each page, which ran the
  synchronous paging generator and pulled every page inside the first `page_loaded`
  callback. It now appends only the newly loaded `_data` per page, so the export
  actually streams instead of materializing the whole collection.

### Internal
- **Developer onboarding rework:** credentials flow through `tests/settings.py` with
  per-flow readiness checks (`delegated`, `delegated-ropc`, `app-only`,
  `app-only-cert`), `python -m tests.doctor`, and `--require <flow>` gating; live
  tests auto-skip when credentials are missing. `.env.example`, `README-dev.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the example quick starts were rewritten, and the dead
  `office365_python_sdk_securevars` reference removed.
- **Setup automation:** `.env.example`/README-dev document the existing
  `examples/entraid/applications/` and `examples/sharepoint/auth/setup/` scripts;
  `certificate_auth.py` prints a paste-ready `.env` block, `applications/create.py`
  gains `--keep`/`--name`, and `rotate_cert.py` uploads a configurable public
  certificate.
- **Certificate setup for Graph:** `applications/rotate_cert.py` gains `--generate`;
  docs say "SharePoint REST API v1" instead of `/_api`.
- **Guided credential setup:** `python -m tests.setup` reads `.env`, prompts only for
  the missing tenant/app id, reuses or creates app credentials, derives the
  SharePoint URLs, and writes `.env` (with `.env.bak` and `--dry-run`). It now also
  asks whether to create a client secret (default no; `--with-secret`/`--no-secret`
  force it; `--yes` keeps it off) and prints how to add one later. Generated
  certificates are no longer tracked.
- **Two-user test model:** `OFFICE365_TEST_USER1`/`OFFICE365_TEST_USER2` replaced by
  `OFFICE365_USERNAME` and optional `OFFICE365_USERNAME_ALT`; `tests/__init__.py`
  still exposes `test_user_principal_name`/`test_user_principal_name_alt`.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-09-27

### Added
- **Locked-file handling (HTTP 423):** typed `FileLockedException` (also
  `SPFileLockedException`) parses the lock holder into `.lock_owner` with remediation
  in `.GUIDANCE`; `retry_on(FileLockedException)` opts into retrying lock errors, and
  `delete_object(bypass_shared_lock=True)` sends `Prefer: bypass-shared-lock` on
  Graph and SharePoint. See `examples/sharepoint/files/handle_locked_file.py`.
- **Idempotent file provisioning:** `DriveItem.ensure_file(path, content,
  on_conflict=...)` reuses or overwrites the leaf file, creating missing parents.
- **Typed CAML query builder:** `Caml` / `CamlQuery.builder()` build `ViewXml` from
  composable expressions (comparisons, field-typed helpers, `Caml.now`, logical joins
  rendering binary-nested CAML, `where/order_by/group_by/row_limit/scope/view_fields`);
  raw `ViewXml`/`parse` remain. New modules under
  `office365/sharepoint/listitems/caml/`.
- `ImportResult` — a deferred, source-agnostic streaming import driver with a
  sequential, batch, or iterated terminal; `ClientObjectCollection.import_records()`
  and `List.from_dataframe()`.
- **Idempotent list imports:** `List.import_dataframe(..., key=..., key_field=...,
  on_conflict="skip"|"upsert")` derives SHA-256 keys and skips/updates existing rows
  (`ImportStats.skipped`, `enforce_unique`, `dry_run`).
- **Resumable imports:** `ImportResult(checkpoint=...)` persists the committed cursor
  per chunk; `resumed_from`/`checkpoint`/`ImportStats.resumed_from` expose the offset;
  `on_error="collect"` records a failing chunk and continues.
- `ClientObjectCollection.clear()` and a `concurrency` argument on
  `Entity.execute_batch()`.
- `OperationStats` shared counter base, specialized by `ImportStats`/`MigrationStats`.
- **Live import progress:** `progress` fires immediately (with the resumed offset),
  per committed chunk, and per completed batch; `run_parallel` reports on the calling
  thread; `execute_batch`'s `success_callback` fires per batch in sequential mode;
  `List.import_from(..., total=...)`.
- **Best-effort migration fidelity:** `preserve_timestamps`/`preserve_permissions`
  applied client-side via `DataSource.read_permissions`, `DataTarget.apply_timestamps`
  and `apply_permissions(item, permissions)` (`PermissionEntry`).
- **Migration guide:** `docs/migration.md`.
- **Server-side migration (full fidelity):** `Site.provision_migration_containers`,
  `provision_migration_queue`, `create_migration_job_encrypted`, and
  `get_migration_job_progress`; `MigrationServerJob.submit_encrypted`/`progress`/
  `status_fn`; `parse_progress_events`.
- **Migration API package layer** (`office365.migration.package`): models for
  `Manifest.xml`/`ExportSettings.xml`/`SystemData.xml`/`UserGroupMap.xml`,
  `PackageBuilder`, `FileSystemStaging`, `BlobStaging` (new `[azure]` extra),
  `create_staging(...)`, and `SharePointPackageTarget`. Covers the document-library
  subset; the generated XML is not yet live-verified.
- **Storage & vendor-neutrality docs:** `docs/migration.md` covers which legs need
  Azure, the `Staging` seam, and a step-by-step example.
- **Encrypted migration staging:** `BlobStaging`/`create_staging` accept an
  `encryption_key` (AES-256-CBC, unique IV); `SharePointPackageTarget` forwards it,
  and `[azure]` now also pulls in `cryptography`.
- **Migration examples:** `migrate_library_serverside.py` and the tenant-free
  `package_library.py`.
- **SPMT-style migration sessions:** `MigrationSession` mirrors the SPMT cmdlets
  (`register`/`get`/`add_task`/`remove_task`/`show`/`start`/`stop`/`unregister`), with
  `MigrationSettings`, `MigrationTask`, and a SharePoint resolver (client-side REST or
  `use_migration_api=True`); `MigrationOptions` gained `created_after`/`modified_after`.
- **`FileVersions` scan** — records files with version history, with the SMAT columns.
- **SMAT report scans:** `CheckedOutFiles`, `LargeExcelFiles`, `BrowserFileHandling`,
  `LongOneDriveUrls`, `ThicketFolder`, and `UnsupportedSiteTemplates`, sharing a
  `SiteScanRecord` base; `WebTemplateType` covers the full `Get-SpoWebTemplate`
  catalog; `Limits.LARGE_EXCEL_FILE` backs the Excel threshold.
- **Locale-independent error classification + SharePoint taxonomy:** deterministic
  `MATCH_PRIORITY` dispatch; `ClientRequestException.hresult`/`.error_type`; a
  `SharePointException` catch-all plus typed `SPFileCheckOutException`,
  `SPListDataValidationException`, `SPFieldValidationException`,
  `SPFieldValueException`, `SPDuplicateValuesFoundException`,
  `SPInvalidLookupValuesException`, `SPContentTypeReadOnlyException`, and
  `SPContentTypeSealedException`.

### Changed
- **Error classification is locale-independent:** exceptions key off the numeric
  HRESULT and/or embedded .NET type name; HTTP 423 disambiguates
  `SPFileCheckOutException` from the shared-lock `FileLockedException` (an unresolved
  423 still maps to `FileLockedException`).
- **Data-pipeline naming (breaking):** `from_*` is the streaming entry (returns
  `ImportResult`) and `queue_*` the deferred path. Removed `import_from`/
  `import_records`/`import_dataframe`/`import_from_file` and `to_json_file`/
  `from_json_file`; `FieldCollection.from_dataframe` → `ensure_from_dataframe`.
- **Architecture:** the data-interchange surface moved onto a new `RecordCollection`
  base (inherited by every typed `EntityCollection`); formats resolve through
  `runtime.converters.registry`; keyed skip/upsert is a pluggable `UpsertTarget`
  implemented by `ListItemUpsertTarget`.
- `import_from`/`import_records` gained `enforce_unique=True` and `dry_run=True`.
- `List` gained record facades (`import_from`/`import_dataframe`/`import_records`,
  `export_to`/`to_dataframe`); `List.from_dataframe` is now deferred.
- `SharePointListSource` reuses the shared record projection.
- `MigrationOptions.preserve_timestamps` defaults to `False`; unhonorable flags raise
  `NotImplementedError`; `preserve_versions` still needs the server-side Migration API.
- `Site.create_migration_ingestion_job` — `azure_queue_report_uri`/`ingestion_task_key`
  are now optional.
- **Streaming export + row-level dead-letter:** `export_to(..., page_size=...)` streams
  appendable formats; with `on_error="collect"` and a `dead_letter`, each failing row
  is dead-lettered.
- **Large-list threshold mitigations:** typed `SPQueryThrottledException`; paged
  `Folder.get_files` (refs #930/#936/#462) and `List.get_items(query, page_size=...)`;
  `List.ensure_indexed`/`Field.ensure_indexed` (the real fix for #427); a warning on
  unpaged filter/sort queries; new `docs/large-lists.md` (including #726).
- **Large-list UX:** list-view collections (`ListItemCollection`, `FileCollection`,
  `FolderCollection`) warn once at the 5,000-item threshold (refs #930/#936);
  `CamlQuery.index_candidates`/`List.index_candidates`; `List.check_query` pre-flights
  a query.
- **Migration-parity vocabulary:** `ImportResult.run(...)` aliases `execute_batch`;
  `ImportResult.verify`; a shared `VerificationReport` (`runtime.verification`).
- **More formats + path/IO parity:** `tsv`, `parquet`, `orc` and `feather`
  (`[parquet]`), `from_sql`/`to_sql` (`[sql]`), `from_duckdb`/`to_duckdb`
  (`[duckdb]`); every reader/writer accepts a path, `PathLike`, or open file.
- **DataFrame ⇄ SharePoint file bridge:** `Folder.write_dataframe`/`File.write_dataframe`,
  `Folder.read_dataframe`/`File.read_dataframe`, and `List.from_file`; codecs are
  `dataframe_to_bytes`/`dataframe_from_bytes`.
- **Typed field mapping on import:** `List.import_from(..., schema={column: FieldType})`
  coerces values into the payload shape; `coerce_field_value`; generic
  `RecordCollection.import_from(..., coerce={key: converter})`.
- **Column mapping:** `import_from(..., mapping={...})` renames source columns/keys.
- **Import verification:** `RecordCollection.verify_keys(keys)` and
  `List.verify_dataframe(df, key=...)`.
- **Dead-letter capture:** `import_from(..., dead_letter="dl.jsonl")` appends each
  collected chunk failure.
- **Import schema evolution:** `List.import_from(..., on_schema_change="evolve"|"fail")`,
  backed by an `ImportResult` `before_chunk` hook.
- **Incremental migration watermark:** `MigrationRunner` uses the persisted
  `Checkpoint.source_watermark` to skip and advance.
- Removed `office365/migration/_util.py`; helpers moved to `runtime.operations`,
  `runtime.converters.scalars`, and `runtime.converters.json_file`. Report writing is
  now per-format (`write_dataset`/`write_formats`).
- `MigrationItem` carries `created` and `author_id`/`editor_id`.
- **Idempotent metadata:** all client-side `ensure_*` share
  `runtime.queries.get_or_create.get_or_create`/`create_or_get` and accept
  `on_conflict="skip"|"update"`.
- `List.ensure_field`/`ensure_fields` and `FieldCollection.from_dataframe` now return
  the ensured entities; `List.ensure_fields_from_dataframe` was removed.
- **Breaking:** `List.from_dataframe()` returns an `ImportResult` driver; `progress`
  is keyword-only.
- The SharePoint list migration target flushes and discards each chunk.

### Fixed
- **Collection-bound OData operations are no longer generated onto item types.** A
  bindable `FunctionImport` whose `this` is `Collection(X)` was attached to item class
  `X`; the SharePoint (v3) and Graph (v4) readers now skip them, removing 49 methods
  from 24 item classes (e.g. `User.remove_by_id`, `Feature.remove`, `SubtitleFile.add`,
  `SitePublishingPage.set_multilingual`, `SiteProperties.get_lock_state_by_id`,
  `MigrationTask.batch_*`).
- **A custom session carrying its own auth handler now counts as credentials (refs #1045).**
  SharePoint requests (and the form-digest and batch paths) skip
  `AuthenticationContext.authenticate_request` when the transport carries a handler
  and nothing is configured.
- **Server-side file imports need a matching `SPListItem` (live-validated).** The
  Migration API silently skips an `SPFile` unless the package also contains its
  `SPListItem`; `PackageBuilder.add_file` now emits it. Every `<User>` must carry
  `SystemId`, and `DeploymentRoles` must not be emitted.
- **`PackageBuilder.add_role_assignment` now defaults `object_type="2"`.** The grant
  itself and `Author`/`ModifiedBy` still don't land (the target SID isn't exposed by
  the SPO REST API; parked).
- **On-prem NTLM auth works again (refs #1045).** `ClientContext(url, allow_ntlm=True)`
  delegates to `AuthenticationContext.with_credentials` and forwards
  `allow_ntlm`/`browser_mode`; the retired-SAML guard still fires for SharePoint Online.
- **`SharePointPackageTarget` no longer emits an empty `ExportSettings` `SiteUrl`.**
  It resolves the site URL or raises a clear error, and accepts a `source_type`.
- **`Manifest.xml` now matches the service shape.** It emits the library root
  `SPFolder`, the `SPDocumentLibrary`, a folder per subfolder and an `SPFile` per file;
  `UserGroupMap.xml` → `UserGroup.xml`; the `ViewFormsList` namespace is fixed.
- **Migration packages now emit the manifest files the API fetches** (`Requirements.xml`,
  `RootObjectMap.xml`, `LookupListMap.xml`, `ViewFormsList.xml`). Failed jobs are
  diagnosable via `MigrationServerJob.all_events`/`errors` and
  `SharePointPackageTarget.events`/`errors`/`diagnose`.
- **`CreateMigrationJobEncrypted` sends the AES key as base64 text** instead of
  decoding it.
- **`$skip` paging no longer collides with a server `$skiptoken`.**
- **Idempotent imports load existing keys on every run**, and `ImportCheckpoint` now
  records a source signature so a mismatch rescans the source.
- DataFrame import no longer silently drops a column colliding with a built-in field
  (it is imported with a `_` suffix and a warning).
- `series_kind`/`field_type_from_kind` handle more kinds and fall back to `Text`
  instead of raising `KeyError`.

## [3.1.1] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed
- SharePoint form digest is cached correctly again (`_valid_from` set on fetch,
  safety-margin refresh), so `/_api/contextInfo` is fetched once per site/run and
  pre-warmed before parallel `execute_batch`.
- A throttled digest refresh (`429`/`503`) is retried honoring `Retry-After`, and an
  expired/invalidated digest (`403`) is refreshed and retried once, surfaced as
  `SecurityValidationException`.
- Whole-batch throttling (`429`/`503`) honors `Retry-After` instead of exponential
  backoff.
- `File.open_binary`/`File.save_binary` no longer percent-encode the whole OData call
  ([#978](https://github.com/vgrem/office365-rest-python-client/issues/978)); only the
  path value is encoded.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added
- **Migration toolkit** — product-agnostic core plus `sharepoint`, `outlook` and
  `teams`: resumable `MigrationJob`/`MigrationSession`, filesystem/SharePoint/JSON/
  Teams archive adapters, parallel transfer, a server-side ingestion job, and
  summary/item/failure reports.
- **SMAT-style pre-migration assessment** — modular scans/containers,
  `MigrationAssessor`/`MigrationTenantAssessor`/`MailboxAssessor`, typed reports
  (`LargeSites`, `LockedSites`, `MailFolders`), and CSV/JSON export.
- **Parallel execution** — `execute_batch(concurrency=N)` on `ClientContext` and
  `GraphClient`, plus `execute_query_parallel(concurrency=N)`; per-request retry
  honoring `Retry-After`.
- **Data pipeline** — CSV/JSON/NDJSON/Excel import-export, `from_csv`/`from_json`/
  `from_records`, dynamic list-item columns, and an optional pandas bridge.
- **SharePoint** — taxonomy term store (OData v2.1/V4), site primitives, folder
  download with version history, zip ↔ folder primitives, `Web.ensure_list`,
  `DriveItem.ensure_folder`, and typed field creators.
- **Generator** — OData function/action generation, a return-type descriptor/resolver,
  and list-typed primitive collection parameters.

### Changed
- Thread-safe auth and form-digest caches (single-flight refresh);
  `ClientContext.clone` shares the auth context and transport.
- First-class retry (exponential backoff + jitter) and throttling primitives;
  `ClientQuery` generics made consistent.
- Examples reorganized into product galleries and an SPMT-style migration flow
  (`assess/` → `migrate/` → `monitor/`).

### Fixed
- Long file paths in moves ([#988](https://github.com/vgrem/office365-rest-python-client/issues/988)) —
  body-based `File.move_by_path`/`MoveCopyUtil.move_file_by_path`; slashes are no
  longer percent-encoded inside OData string literals.
- Bulk OneDrive downloads ([#881](https://github.com/vgrem/office365-rest-python-client/issues/881)) —
  `download_folder` paginates children.
- SharePoint paging falls back to `$skip` with no next link
  ([#915](https://github.com/vgrem/office365-rest-python-client/issues/915)); custom
  headers are preserved across pages.
- Apostrophes in file paths ([#884](https://github.com/vgrem/office365-rest-python-client/issues/884)),
  in-memory upload streams ([#793](https://github.com/vgrem/office365-rest-python-client/issues/793)),
  and sharing-token UTF-8/padding ([#875](https://github.com/vgrem/office365-rest-python-client/issues/875)).
- `@odata.type` casting for directory collections
  ([#921](https://github.com/vgrem/office365-rest-python-client/issues/921)); principal
  path precedence ([#895](https://github.com/vgrem/office365-rest-python-client/issues/895));
  delta-token/custom query-param handling
  ([#948](https://github.com/vgrem/office365-rest-python-client/issues/948)); malformed
  JSON surfaced as `ClientRequestException`.

### Internal
- Generator metadata readers/model moved from `office365/runtime/odata` to
  `generator/odata`; generator checkpoints are no longer tracked.
- Unit suite consolidated into themed modules; pyright clean.

## [3.0.0]

### Breaking
- **Python 2 dropped** — minimum Python version is now 3.8
- **ACS/SAML retirement** — `with_user_credentials` now raises `RuntimeError` for SharePoint Online. Use `with_username_and_password` (MSAL ROPC) instead. ACS App-Only (`with_client_credentials`) marked as deprecated.
- **USGovernment GCC endpoints corrected** — were using wrong URLs
- Model surface updated across SharePoint, Graph, and security namespaces (see Removed below)

### Added
- Full type hints across all modules (runtime, directory, onedrive, outlook, teams, sharepoint, intune, and more)
- `with_username_and_password` (MSAL ROPC) for SharePoint Online auth
- Substantially expanded Graph model coverage: Defender/security evidence types, subject rights requests, retention labels, threat intelligence, and more
- Expanded Intune (Cloud PC) and Teams admin/communication model surface
- New query/example modules for SharePoint, Graph, and Entra ID scenarios

### Changed
- Modernized SharePoint models and generator with Python 3 type hints (`Self`, `X | None`)
- `datetime.utcnow()` replaced with timezone-aware alternatives (Python 3.12+ deprecation)
- Generator tooling: `entity_type_name` support, EnumType generation, template-driven model props
- Credential/guard improvements for Entra ID multi-resource (via `ResourceName`)

### Fixed
- Cryptography CVEs updated to 48.0.0
- Circular import in `client_runtime_context.py` / `read_entity.py`
- `NameError: name 'List' is not defined` in `fields/collection.py`
- `single()` and `first()` return types (never return `None`)
- `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'` when SharePoint returns a string error payload
- Pyright type-checking errors across the library and tests

### Removed
- Python 2.7 support
- `.travis.yml` (use GitHub Actions instead)
- `requirements.txt` / `requirements-dev.txt` (use `uv`/`pyproject.toml`)
- Deprecated/renamed model classes superseded by the regenerated schema

### Internal
- CI moved to GitHub Actions (ruff, pyright, offline pytest)
- Dependency management via `uv` and `pyproject.toml`
