"""
Cross-team channel inventory and audit.

Lists every channel across teams with its membership type, archive
status, and email, and summarizes how channels are structured.

Private and shared channels extend the collaboration surface (guests,
external members), so this flags them for security review.

Requires delegated or application permissions:
    Team.ReadBasic.All     List all teams
    Channel.ReadBasic.All  List channels
