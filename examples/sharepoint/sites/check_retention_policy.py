"""
Check which SharePoint sites are covered by Microsoft Purview
retention policies.

Identifies sites with and without retention coverage. Useful for
governance audits to ensure all sites have the required retention
settings applied.

Inspired by SPOSitesRetention.ps1 from Office 365 for IT Pros.

Required delegated permissions:
    Sites.Read.All              Read all SharePoint sites
    RecordsManagement.Read.All  Read retention policies and labels
    User.ReadBasic.All          Resolve display names
