# Entra ID Directory Roles

Manage Entra ID (Azure AD) directory roles — list activated roles, see who
holds them, assign/remove members, and report on privileged assignments.

> **Directory roles vs unified roles:** the `directory_roles` API covers the
> system-defined **administrator roles** (Global Administrator, Security
> Administrator, …). `role_management.directory` covers the **unified role
> definitions/assignments** used by PIM and custom roles.

| List members of a role | [`list_role_members.py`](./list_role_members.py) | `RoleManagement.Read.Directory` | [directoryRole list members](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/directoryrole-list-members) |
| Roles for the current user | [`for_current_user.py`](./for_current_user.py) | `RoleManagement.Read.Directory` | [user memberOf](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-list-memberof) |

## Notes

- **Roles must be activated before they appear in `directory_roles`.** The
  `assign_role.py` example activates a role (idempotently) before assigning.
  `remove_role.py`/`list_role_members.py` operate on already-activated roles.
- **PIM** (`pim_report.py`) reads *eligible* and *active* assignments through
  `role_management.directory`, which covers both built-in and custom roles.
