## Quick start

Every script here is runnable from a repository checkout:

```bash
cp .env.example .env                                  # fill in the credentials you need
uv run python -m tests.doctor                          # confirm what is configured
uv run python examples/auth/with_client_secret.py
```

Examples authenticate through the same central loader as the tests
(`tests/settings.py`, which reads `.env`) and reuse the test credentials. See
[README-dev.md](../README-dev.md) for the full local setup, the authentication
flow matrix and the certificate recipe.

```python
from office365.graph_client import GraphClient

client = GraphClient(tenant="contoso.onmicrosoft.com").with_client_secret(
    "client_id", "client_secret"
)

me = client.me.get().execute_query()
print(f"Signed in as: {me.display_name}")
```

See [`auth/`](./auth/) for all supported authentication flows, and
[`sharepoint/auth/`](./sharepoint/auth/) for the SharePoint-specific guidance
(app-only automation uses a **certificate**, not a client secret).
